# nuke_show_setup_manager
A Nuke Python script that creates a UI that sets up and automates the load-in of new Nuke scripts for compositors.


HOW  IT WORKS:
Its a tool that prevents setting kickbacks for compositors in a show. A UI that helps lead compositors set up a preset for a show/shot comp requirements, and lets the compositors load in the preset, type their name, and start working right away.

The benefits:
Less lost time teaching compositors what to add in their colorspaces, and fewer kickbacks in the publishing of finals due to colorspace, frame range, and aspect ratio mistakes.

HOW TO INSTALL:
Simply download the repository into your .nuke file and add these lines of code into your init.py file.

    import nuke
    import nuke_panel_setup_lanh 
    
   # Create a menu item to launch your plugin
    toolbar = nuke.menu('Nuke')
    my_menu = toolbar.addMenu('AN Tools', index = 1000)

    # Add a command to the menu that calls the function to show your UI
    my_menu.addCommand('Shot setup', 'nuke_panel_setup_lanh.main()')
